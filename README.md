# React + Redux BW

Quick exercise on React with Redux. The goal is to take an existing react app that has stateful components and apply the Redux pattern to it. The app we'll be working with as a Birthday wish app.  You can use it to determine if your birthday wish will come true. There's nothing rediculouse about it. 

Each lesson is in a new branch. Start with `00-component-state` and work your way to `06-wish-timer` The solution for each lesson is in the associated branch with the word `-solution` appended to it. e.g.

- `03-Actions`
- `03-Actions-Solution`

Check out `00-component-state` to get started.
