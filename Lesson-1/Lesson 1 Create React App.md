## Lesson 1 Create React App

Use Create react app to skip the configuration setup process (Babel, Webpack, Jest etc..). 



Install **Create React App**. Open up a terminal and install the NPM package globally.

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```



Use Create React App to create a project. In you terminal navigate to a directory where you would like the React-Birthday-Wish to live

```
cd ~/projects
```

Run the `create-react-app` command to create the starter. Name it what ever you like. I'll go with `birthday-wish`

```
create-react-app birthday-wish
```
